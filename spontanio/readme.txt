<strong>Spontanio: where you are free to just be</strong>

Everyone uses video chat these days, but it's such a hassle, right? Scheduling meetings, sending out invitations, 
forcing people to log in and install an app, getting bombarded with ads...
Wouldn't it be nice if you could just offer your website visitors a simple way to spontaneously chat, 
right inside their browser without any setup? Well look no further...

Spontanio is a platform that gives people spaces where they can be their authentic selves, without worrying that everything 
they do will be monitored and monetized by Big Social. It allows folks to casually interact with others, 
wherever they are, whenever they feel like it. It's all about genuine conversation, not "meetings" with "teams".
This service is completely free of charge for basic use, though you will get some sweet extras if you upgrade to a 
premium account. We make it super easy for you to create a room that's fully tailored to your brand, using one of our
pre-built themes, or creating your own. It only takes seconds to get started!
