This plugin allows you to offer free group video chat for your website! Super easy to set up and use. Customize for your brand. Options for selling, scheduling, and more.

## Spontanio: where you are free to just be
Everyone uses video chat these days, but it's such a hassle, right? Scheduling meetings, sending out invitations, 
forcing people to log in and install an app, getting bombarded with ads...
Wouldn't it be nice if you could just offer your website visitors a simple way to spontaneously get together, 
right inside their browser without any setup? Well look no further...

Spontanio is a platform that gives people virtual spaces where they can be their authentic selves. 
It allows folks to casually interact with others, wherever they are, whenever they feel like it. 
It's all about genuine conversation, not "meetings" with "teams".

This service is completely free of charge for basic use, though you will get some sweet extras if you upgrade to a 
premium account. We make it super easy for you to create a room that's fully tailored to your brand, using one of our
pre-built themes, or creating your own. It only takes seconds to get started!
